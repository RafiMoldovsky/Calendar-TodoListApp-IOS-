# Calendar-TodoListApp-IOS-
Goal: 
I recently started a personal project to develop an IOS app that would combine my needs for a calendar and todo list using Swift. 
The goal for this app is to be able to put all my assignments and due dates in one place on my iphone and have an autogenerated todolist from this calendar. 
I also plan on adding more features to both the list and the calendar as I continue to discover what maximizes my productivity.
